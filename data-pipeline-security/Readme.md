*Secrets & Identity (Implementation Details)**

1. **Secrets Management**  
   → Tools: HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, K8s SealedSecrets  
   → Ban .env in repos; enable pre-commit secret scanning (gitleaks, truffleHog)  
   → Auto-rotate keys every 30–90 days via Terraform/Ansible  
   → Verify: No secrets in Git history, rotation logs in SIEM

2. **Least Privilege IAM**  
   → Per-job/per-service identities with exact resource scoping  
   → CI/CD runners: READ-only to prod by default  
   → Time-boxed elevation with full audit trail  
   → Verify: Policy analyzer shows no wildcards, elevation logs reviewed weekly

3. **Zero-Trust Architecture**  
   → Every service call authenticates + authorizes + logs  
   → Deny-by-default network policies (K8s NetworkPolicy, AWS Security Groups)  
   → No "trusted internal subnet" assumptions  
   → Verify: Network policy audit, failed auth alerts trigger

**Encryption & Data Protection**

4. **End-to-End Encryption**  
   → TLS 1.3 in transit (including internal services), AES-256/KMS at rest  
   → Automated cert expiry checks, HSTS on edges  
   → Verify: SSL Labs A+ rating, KMS key rotation enabled

5. **Field-Level Protection**  
   → Tokenize/pseudonymize PII at ingest (not in warehouse)  
   → Envelope encryption (KMS + pgcrypto) for high-risk columns  
   → Never load raw PII into dev/staging environments  
   → Verify: PII scanner finds zero unmasked records in non-prod

6. **Database Security Controls**  
   → Enable TDE (Transparent Data Encryption)  
   → Row-Level Security (Postgres RLS, Snowflake) for user/tenant scoping  
   → Separate read/write roles, no shared admin accounts  
   → Verify: Query logs show RLS enforcement, admin access <1% of queries

**Container & Runtime Security**

7. **Runtime Hardening**  
   → Non-root user, read-only filesystem, drop Linux capabilities  
   → Seccomp/AppArmor profiles, no shell in prod images  
   → Block metadata abuse (AWS IMDSv2 with hop limit=1)  
   → Verify: Image scan shows no root processes, metadata endpoint unreachable

8. **Service Mesh & Network Isolation**  
   → Mutual TLS between all services (Istio, Linkerd, or Envoy sidecars)  
   → K8s NetworkPolicy so only approved pods reach databases  
   → Verify: mTLS metrics in Prometheus, unauthorized connections blocked

**Supply Chain & CI/CD**

9. **Supply Chain Security**  
   → Generate SBOMs for all images/dependencies (Syft)  
   → Scan in CI (Trivy, Grype, pip-audit), fail builds on critical CVEs  
   → Sign images (cosign), enforce signature verification at deploy  
   → Pin base images to SHA256 digests  
   → Verify: Zero unsigned images in prod, SBOM in artifact registry

10. **CI/CD Isolation**  
    → Runners have READ-only prod access by default  
    → Separate deploy pipelines for dev/staging/prod  
    → Require code review + approval for prod deploys  
    → Verify: Deployment logs show approver identity, no direct commits to prod

**Monitoring & Incident Response**

11. **Detection & Alerting**  
    → Alert on: failed Vault access, unusual S3 reads, anomalous SQL, IAM policy changes  
    → Runtime sensors (Falco) for container escape patterns  
    → Verify: Weekly alert drills, <5 min mean time to detect (MTTD)

12. **Log Hygiene**  
    → Structured logs with auto-redaction (tokens, passwords, PII)  
    → Encrypted at rest, short retention (90 days max for sensitive logs)  
    → Verify: Log sample contains zero secrets, PII redaction rate >99%

13. **Data Egress Control**  
    → Restrict outbound to approved domains/S3 buckets (egress firewall)  
    → DLP rules on exports, watermark every extract  
    → Data catalog tracks owner + expiry for all extracts  
    → Verify: Blocked egress attempts logged, catalog coverage >95%

**Backup & Recovery**

14. **Disaster-Proof Backups**  
    → Cross-account/region storage with different KMS keys  
    → Immutability/Object Lock enabled where available  
    → Restore drills quarterly with pass/fail criteria  
    → Verify: Latest backup <24 hours old, last restore drill passed

**Culture & Process**

15. **Incident Readiness**  
    → Written runbooks for common scenarios  
    → Break-glass roles (short TTL, full audit)  
    → Key revocation playbook, 24-hour secret rotation SLA  
    → Verify: Tabletop exercise quarterly, runbook updated after each incident

16. **Environment Separation**  
    → Prod: full encryption + audit, dedicated AWS account/VPC  
    → Dev: synthetic or masked data only, separate network  
    → Test: speed over security, zero prod credentials  
    → Verify: No prod data in dev (DLP scan), network segmentation tested
